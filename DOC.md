### Gulp

What is Gulp? One description is that Gulp is a task runner. Another would be that itâ€™s a toolkit for automating time-consuming tasks.

In the gulpfiles.js there are functions that triggered when you run gulp in the terminal.

I configured gulp so it watches the style.css file and the js file.

That each time you make any changes to one of those files gulp will update the browser without refreshing the page.

I also configured to minify all the images, and process a sass file into css.
